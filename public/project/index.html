            <h2>About Our Project</h2>
            <p>Air pollution poses a serious threat to both human health and the environment. It is caused by a variety of pollutants including particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and ground-level ozone (O₃). These pollutants, often measured in parts per million (PPM) or micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³), can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and other long-term health problems.</p>
            <p>This project is dedicated to monitoring and analyzing air quality in real-time. Our system collects data on ambient temperature (in °C), PPM levels of harmful pollutants, and evaluates overall comfort levels based on standard air quality indices (AQI). By integrating sensors and data analytics, we provide accurate insights into pollution levels across various environments—urban, industrial, and residential.</p>
            <p>The goal is to create awareness and enable individuals, communities, and authorities to take timely action. The dashboard displays real-time graphs, trends, and alerts that help users understand when air quality deteriorates beyond safe limits. This kind of monitoring is especially important for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
            <p>Our platform empowers users to make informed decisions, such as limiting outdoor exposure during high pollution hours or using air purifiers and protective gear. Navigate to the Data page to explore in-depth air quality measurements, pollutant breakdowns, and long-term environmental trends.</p>
